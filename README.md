# Sci-Fi-Collab
The Greatest Story there ever was...


There were 3 intrepid cosmonauts lost in space..

With only a pulse drive and an unlimited supply of dippin' dots.

They flew along trading dippin' dots for cosmic oddities.

They were loved by all ..  except the Daleks. 

The Daleks don't like anyone.


CHAPTER 2: THE EMBIGGENING OF ALL 

    It wasn't until they got to the Citadel that any of the missionaries realized their error. There was, in fact, three different Citadels scattered across the timespace. Unfortunately two of the missionaries were actually in Wyoming so no one really knew what to do next, because until that moment no one had believed that the mythical land of Wyoming was real.
