# Sci-Fi-Collab
The Greatest Story there ever was...

There were 3 intrepid cosmonauts lost in space..

With only a pulse drive and an unlimited supply of dippin' dots.

They flew along trading dippin' dots for cosmic oddities.

They were loved by all ..  except the Daleks. 

The Daleks don't like anyone.
